# 🔮 Magic Tarot - AI Powered iOS App

**Magic Tarot** is a modern iOS application that combines the ancient art 
of Tarot with the power of Artificial Intelligence.
Unlike standard tarot apps with static descriptions, Magic Tarot uses 
**Gemini 1.5 Flash AI** to interpret card spreads based on the user's 
current context, acting as a personal spiritual guide ("Witch Veronica").
